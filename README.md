# Electoral Consolidation and Independent Candidate Viability in India  
## Comparative Structural Analysis of Pre- and Post-2013 Elections

---

## Overview
This project examines structural changes in electoral competition in India by analysing the performance of independent candidates across selected political units before and after 2013.

The analysis evaluates whether the declining electoral strength of independent candidates is primarily driven by changes in candidate participation or by broader structural shifts in party competition.

---

## Research Objectives
- Assess whether independent candidates have experienced a decline in electoral success over time.
- Examine whether vote share concentration among major political parties has increased.
- Test whether changes in independent candidate participation explain electoral outcomes.
- Evaluate whether Indian electoral competition is moving toward greater bipolarity.

## Data Sources
- IndiaVotes.com
- Election Commission of India (official electoral results)
- Lok Dhaba – Ashoka University Political Database

All data used are from publicly available election results.

## Sampling Design
The study uses a structured comparative sample designed to capture broad India-wide electoral dynamics.

Selection criteria:

- Representation across major geographic zones:
  - North
  - South
  - East
  - West
  - Central India
  - North-East
- At least one, and where possible two, political units from each zone.
- Combination of:
  - State Assembly electoral systems
  - National Parliamentary electoral system (India)

This sampling approach ensures the analysis captures structural national trends rather than region-specific effects.

## Analytical Framework
Electoral indicators were compared across:

- Three election cycles before 2013
- Three election cycles after 2013

Key constructed measures:

- Average independent seat share
- Combined vote share of top two political parties
- Independent candidate counts
- Independent candidate density (candidates per constituency)
- Change metrics (post-2013 minus pre-2013 averages)

Seat normalization was used to ensure comparability across political units with different numbers of constituencies.

## Key Findings

### 1. Decline in Independent Electoral Representation
9 out of 11 political units in the sample show a decline in average independent seat share in the post-2013 period.

This indicates a broad structural weakening of independent representation across diverse electoral systems.

---

### 2. Increasing Vote Share Concentration Among Major Parties
8 out of 11 political units show an increase in the combined vote share of the top two political parties in the post-2013 period.

This suggests increasing concentration of voter alignment around major party blocs.

---

### 3. Candidate Participation Does Not Explain Electoral Outcomes
Changes in independent candidate density do not show a consistent relationship with changes in independent vote share.

This indicates that variation in the number of independent candidates is not the primary driver of independent electoral performance.

---

## Interpretation
The evidence suggests a structural shift in the nature of electoral competition.

Independent candidate performance appears increasingly shaped by consolidation of voter preferences around major political parties rather than by candidate participation levels.

---

## Conclusion
The findings are consistent with a gradual movement toward more bipolar patterns of electoral competition across diverse political units.

As party competition consolidates, independent candidates appear to be becoming structurally less electorally relevant over time.

This reflects transformation in voter alignment and competitive dynamics rather than simple changes in candidate participation.
